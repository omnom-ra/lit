## Eagle's Revenge
Night winds rushing past cabin  
Dead deer on a pole  
Shots as a hollow yellow swoops by  

Dance around a cold body, and a cold warrior arrives  
Recited a rookie deed and yelled Hi! Body Falls!  
Another tale and more dust

## Dear (Orange) Desire,
They pontificated authenticity & sincerity, while I gazed at your writing intently.   
Distant scripts with loose tongues popped, as you joted top down.  
Caught in your web, skrt skrt!

## Dear Desire,
U glanced at my palm faced book, and I acted accordingly to develop my well zoned ida juju to balance that retro high.

## Cappin Stripperien Faun
Driving in the central reservation, shaking like a free range roomba  
Shaving off that horny high while she glanced at my shoe, to have a *niñX* not of mine  
Call me when you want to have dimsum

## Dear Scada Minty,
Sphinxes charging through Cisco nights  
Shedding coats in the rain looking for loved ones  
Chatty Babis lasting for softness  
Binding Minotaurs preempting virtually  
Swell magpies reflecting smiles
